The next player can choose either an actor from the current movie or a movie featuring the current actor.\n\n4. Play continues in this fashion until a player answers incorrectly. An incorrect answer results in a strike. When a player reaches the strike limit, they are eliminated from the game. The last remaining player is the winner.\n\n"
